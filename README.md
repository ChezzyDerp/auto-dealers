# SPA application auto-dealers

This application is written without a backend, instead it uses a regular module that returns promises
To add car dealerships, you need to add an object to the dealers array located in: #./src/api/dealers.js

This project was written without some material ui library.
Was written a routing on react-router-dom(v6), which makes it possible to get a page by url type - dealers?name=Nissan
